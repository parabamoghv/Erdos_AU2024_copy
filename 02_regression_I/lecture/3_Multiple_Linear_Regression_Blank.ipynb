    "#### Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simple linear regression notebook we noted many caveats.  Those remarks apply equally well here!  If our goal is inference we have a new danger:  **multicollinearity** of the predictors!  Intuitively if some of our predictors are themselves strongly correlated (say length and diameter) then it becomes difficult to disambiguate their effects, leading to wider confidence intervals for the coefficients of these parameters.  Mathematically, multicollinearity means that $X^\\top X$ has a large condition number. As a result changes in $y$ can lead to large changes in $(X^\\top X)^{-1}(X^\\top y)$. We will return to these issues when we get to inference in lectures 5 and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major warning:  we didn't do any Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on our other predictors.  Some of these other predictors could, conceivably, have non-linear relationships with the outcome in which case applying \"vanilla\" linear regression would be inappropriate."
