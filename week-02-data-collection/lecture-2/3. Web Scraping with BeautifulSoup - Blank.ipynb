    "## Common problems while web scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messy or inconsistent HTML code\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen one problem that you can encounter while web scraping, small and messy differences in HTML code that make automating your scraping more difficult. It is important to note that 538 is actually not very messy in the grand scheme of the world wide web. For example, you can come across websites that do not label their HTML elements with `id`s or `class`es or any other kind of distinguishing meta data. This makes automation incredibly difficult. Other websites may offer no consistency from page to page. In such cases there may not be a quick or easy fix, you typically just have to hack something together and hope it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Too many requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeatedly sending requests to the same website can raise a flag at the site's server after which your IP address will be blocked from receiving future request results for some period of time. This is why it is good practice to space out your requests to a single website. You can do so with the `sleep` function in the `time` module, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep\">https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep</a>. While this decreases your risk of being flagged as a bot/scraper, it is also just being a good denizen of the internet. Sending too many requests to a single website in a short amount of time can mess with that website's ability to function for other visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bot detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Some websites have been set up to detect bot/scraper activity regardless of the number of times you send a request. Sometimes there are ways around this, but the specific approach depends upon how the website is blocking your request. To counter such detection do a web search for the specific error or response code you are getting and look for a helpful stack overflow or stackexchange post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User interactive content\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the content on a page may be dependent on the actions of a user visiting that page. For example, there are websites where data tables do not load until the user has clicked a button or scrolled down the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `selenium`\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to access information that requires user input is with `selenium`, <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/\">https://www.selenium.dev/</a>. `selenium` installation instructions can be found here, <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/selenium/\">https://pypi.org/project/selenium/</a>, and documentation on how to use the package can be found here, <a href=\"https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html\">https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html</a>."
