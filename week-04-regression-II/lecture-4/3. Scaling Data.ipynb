    "\n",

    "#### `fit`, `transform` and `fit_transform` & scaling for train test splits\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering what `fit`, `transform` and `fit_transform` do. Let's describe:\n",
    "- `fit` performs a fit of the `scaler` object, for `StandardScaler` this means finding the mean and standard deviation of each column and storing it. `fit` must be called <i>before</i> `transform`.\n",
    "- `transform` is what actually performs the scaling, for `StandardScaler` this means substracting the respective means and dividing by the respective standard deviations for each column. `transform` must be called <i>after</i> `fit`.\n",
    "- `fit_transform` does this all in one fell swoop, i.e. it fits the `scaler` object then uses the fit to transform the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why do we need anything other than `fit_transform`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent question! In the example above we probably could have just used `fit_transform`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is because we were not dealing with train test splits, validation sets or cross-validation. We consider scaling the data part of the model, meaning the algorithm/model was fit using the data scaled with the training set's means and standard deviations. For example, if we scaled data prior to fitting a linear regression model, then $\\hat{\\beta}$ was found using the data scaled according to the training set (using the means and standard deviations of the training set columns). To assess how that particular model performs we must also scale any validation set, cross-validation holdout set or test set using the same exact scaling (i.e. using the means and standard deviations from the training set).\n",
