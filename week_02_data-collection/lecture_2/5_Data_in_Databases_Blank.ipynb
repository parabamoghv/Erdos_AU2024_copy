    "## What is a relational database\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database is a collection of tables or data sets that are related to one another through a series of key values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example consider all the data involved with operating a business that sells physical goods. For simplicity, let's say that there are two sets of data of which the business owner wants to keep track: purchases and customers. A relational database would store such data in a Purchases Table and a Customer Table. Each row of the purchases table would contain all of the data associated with an individual purchase, including the customer that made the purchase and a unique identifier for the purchase. Similarly, each row of the customer table will contain all the data for a unique customer including a unique identifier code. Each purchase can then be linked to the data associated with each customer through these unique keys. The purchases table will contain a column containing the id of the customer that made the purchase like so:\n",
    "<img src=\"database_example.png\" width=\"70%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Linking data in this way gives you the ability to store and query the data in an efficient manner to answer questions like:\n",
    "- Are men more likely to buy item A than women?\n",
    "- Who should we target our advertising dollars to for product X?\n",
    "- What groups should receive coupon emails for items similar to item Y?\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "While I just said we will learn how to use python to interact with data bases, we first have to take a detour into SQL. SQL, or structured query language, is a programming language whose purpose is to submit <i>queries</i> to databases. You can use SQL queries to:\n",
    "- Create databases and tables,\n",
    "- Enter data into tables,\n",
    "- Remove data from tables,\n",
    "- Delete tables and databases,\n",
    "- Retrieve data that meets your specifications and\n",

    "\n",
    "### SELECTing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL the way you can retrieve data from a table within a database is a `SELECT` statement. The syntax of a `SELECT` statement is as follows:\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE conditional_statement\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT` informs the database that you want to retrieve some data,\n",
    "- The ` * ` portion is a space where you can specify the precise columns you would like returned, if you want all of the columns returned you input a ` * `,\n",
    "- `FROM table_name` tells the database what table you would like to get data from and\n",
    "- `WHERE conditional_statement` is an optional argument you can include if you only want entries that specify a certain conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
