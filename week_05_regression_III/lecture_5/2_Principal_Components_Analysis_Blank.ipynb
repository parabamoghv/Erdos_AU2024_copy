    "\n",
    "PCA looks to reduce the dimension of a data set by projecting the data  onto a lower dimensional space that captures as much of the original variance as possible. Thinking in terms of optimization, your goal is to project into a lower dimensional space in a way that maximizes variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a heuristic algorithm:\n",
    "1. Center your data so that each feature has 0 mean, this is done for convenience.\n",
    "2. Find the direction in space along which projections have the highest variance, this produces the first principal component.\n",
    "3. Find the direction orthogonal to the first principal component that maximizes variance, this is the second principal component.\n",
