Another way of thinking about this is that OLS will give you the same results no matter what units you use for your features:  for example if $x_1$ is height in meters and $x_1'$ is height in centimeters, then the OLS estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1'$ would be related by $\\hat{\\beta}_1' = 100 \\hat{\\beta}_1$.  Changing the unit from m to cm just changes the unit of $\\beta$ from $\\frac{\\textrm{units}}{m}$ to $\\frac{\\textrm{units}}{cm}$.\n",

As a consequence, both Ridge and Lasso will prioritize keeping these predictors in the model, since the coefficient is not very \"expensive\" in terms of parameter size but does a lot to decrease the MSE.\n",
