    "\n",
    "While we introduced linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a classification algorithm, it was originally proposed by Fisher as a supervised dimension reduction technique, <a href=\"https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15227/1/138.pdf\">https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15227/1/138.pdf</a>. In particular, the initial goal was to project the features, $X$, corresponding to a binary output, $y$, onto a single dimension which best separates the possible classes. This single dimension has come to be known as <i>Fisher's discriminant</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"problem\" you will learn how this works, and then reproduce Fisher's results on the iris data set (restricted to the versicolor and setosa classes) using `sklearn`'s `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` model object.\n",
