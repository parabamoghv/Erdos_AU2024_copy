    "## Using SVD to find low rank approximations of a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  I learned this story about variational characterizations originally from [Qiaochu Yuan's blog](https://qchu.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/singular-value-decomposition/), which is also an excellent take on all of this SVD content.  They are more terse and less geometric in their exposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how SVD gives low rank approximations, we should first understand the following two **variational** approach to the singular vectors and values:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** (First Variational Characterization of singular values) Let $X$ be an $n \\times p$ matrix. Let $j \\in \\{1,2,3,...,p\\}$. We can characterize $\\sigma_j$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_j = \\max_{\\substack{ V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^p \\\\ \\textrm{dim}(V) = j}} \\min_{\\substack{ \\vec{v} \\in V \\\\ \\vert\\vec{v}\\vert = 1}} \\vert M \\vec{v}\\vert\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, to find $\\sigma_j$ we look at **all** subspaces of dimension $j$ of the domain, minimize $\\vert M \\vec{v}\\vert$ over the unit ball in that subspace.  Different subspaces give us different minimum values.  We choose the subspace $V$ which maximizes this minimum value.  In that case, the minimum value is $\\sigma_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been following along, this should not be a surprizing characterization!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the proof.\n",

    "This is true just by construction of the right singular vectors.\n",

The operator norm of a matrix $M$ is largest singular value of $M$ (aka the maximum value of $\\vert M\\vert$ on the unit sphere).\n",

By the second variational characterization, there must be a unit vector $\\vec{v} \\in \\textrm{Null}(M_j)$ with $\\vert X \\vec{v}\\vert \\geq \\sigma_{j+1}$.  But $\\vert X \\vec{v}\\vert = \\vert X\\vec{v} - M_k\\vec{v}\\vert$ since $M_k\\vec{v} = 0$.  Hence the operator norm of $X - M_k$ is at least $\\sigma_{j+1}$.\n",

So we can see that largest singular value of this matrix is $\\sigma_{j+1}$, which is its operator norm."
