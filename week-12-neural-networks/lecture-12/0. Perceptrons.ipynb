    "## What is an artificial neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a technique that that loosely tries to mimic the network of neurons that make up brains. The idea being that we are trying to create learning algorithms that copy in some very loose sense how humans learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The building blocks of the vast complex network of the brain is a single neuron, while the building blocks of an artificial neural network is a <i>perceptron</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start at the beginning with this simple building block and then expand into slightly more complex neural networks in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn in the setting of a classification problem, but be aware that neural nets can be applied in a variety of settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have $n$ observations of $m$ features stored in $m$ $n$ by $1$ column vectors, $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_m$, and let $X = \\left(X_1 | X_2 | \\dots |X_m\\right)$, and we want to predict some target $y$. <i>Note: we can include a column of $1$s, but we will leave it out for this formulation. When this is done we say that the perceptron has a bias term.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\sigma$ be some nonlinear function from $\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. For classification we take $\\sigma = \\text{sgn}$, the sign function, i.e. $\\sigma(x) = 1$ if $x>0$ and $\\sigma(x) = -1$ if $x<0$. In the language of neural networks we call $\\sigma$ an activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons make an estimation of $y$, called $\\hat{y}$, like so\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\sigma(w_1 X_1 + w_2  X_2 + \\dots + w_m X_m) = \\sigma(Xw),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where in a potential abuse of notation I take $\\sigma(Xw)$ to mean $\\sigma$ applied to each of the $n$ entries of $Xw$, and $w=\\left(w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_m\\right)^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I let $x=\\left(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_m\\right)$ denote a single observation then I can picture this like so.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"perceptron.png\" width=\"50%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of diagram is known as the <i>architecture</i> of the neural network. <i>A perceptron with a bias term would have a \"bias\" node added whose weight is denoted with a $b$.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "The column of nodes are referred to as the input layer because these are the inputs into the perceptron, the output node has both $\\Sigma$ and $\\sigma$ because this is where our weighted sum ($\\Sigma$) and nonlinear transformation ($\\sigma$) occurs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the while we did not include a bias term (adding a constant to $Xw$) this can easily be done, we just left it out for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the $w$\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we find the weights?\n",
    "\n",
    "First the weights are randomly selected. Then you use a single data point from the training set, $X^{(i)}$, and you calculate the error, $y^{(i)}-\\hat{y}^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then update $w$ like so:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{\\text{update}} = w_{\\text{current}} + \\alpha (y^{(i)}-\\hat{y}^{(i)}) X^{(i)} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha$ is the learning rate of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron will cycle through all of the training points and continue to adjust the weights until it converges to a weight vector $w$. Each cycle through the training set is called an <i>epoch</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the training points are chosen at random without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that this can be performed small batches of training points, at which point the batches are chosen randomly without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the algorithm can be rewritten to work in parallel, <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/10-605/parallel-perceptrons.pdf\">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/10-605/parallel-perceptrons.pdf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167819106800177\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167819106800177</a>.\n",
