    "Convolutional neural networks were developed to work with grid based data sets. This is particularly useful for classification problems involving images, which have a natural grid structure where each grid point is a pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea underlying a convolutional neural network is \"What if we paid attention to small portions of an image instead of looking at all of the image at once?\". Essentially the convovlutional net pays attention to local features of the data as opposed to a feed forward net that pays attention to the global features. Let's see how this is done with some images.\n",

    "##### How feed forward networks examine data\n",

    "Pooling layers work by sliding a square grid over each grid in the convolutional layer, taking the maximum value captured in the square. The convolutional layer's grid size is shrunken by sliding the pooling square around with a stride value larger than $1$. The most common pooling square size is $2\\times 2$ with a stride value of $2$.\n",

Also note that you can use different pooling grid sizes and strides, but $2 \\times 2$ and a stride of $2$ are the most common choices.\n",
