    "\n",
    "A common analogy used when describing APIs is that of a waiter. The waiter comes to your table, recieves your order, gives your order to the chef, then retrieves the cooked food and takes it back to your table. In this analogy you are you, the waiter is the API and the chef is the web application. Schematically it looks like this:\n",

    "While we may be able to write custom code to scrape these websites or applications ourselves, it often behooves us to use APIs when they exist and are accessible. For one, many websites may have it in their terms of service that you have to use this route for data collection. Moreover, interacting with the API is probably much easier and more efficient."
